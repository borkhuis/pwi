== Labels ==

To translate the labels fill in the labels with texts in your language, or just with different texts. The following texts can be translated:

|| *Label* || *Default* ||
|| photo || photo ||
|| photos || photos ||
|| albums || Back to albums ||
|| slideshow || Display slideshow ||
|| loading || PWI fetching data... ||
|| page || Page ||
|| prev || Previous ||
|| next || Next ||
|| devider || | ||

See [#Example Example] below on how to add these to your configuration.

== Months ==

Next to labels also the name of the months can be translated. By adding the following line to your options with the correct month-names you can localize your setup.

{{{
        months: ["January","February","March","April","May","June",
                 "July","August","September","October","November","December"]
}}}

== Example ==

Below is an example on how to change certain settings and labels of PWI. Make sure you end each setting with a comma except for the last one.

{{{
$(document).ready(function() {

	var options = {
		username: 'YourPicasaUserName',
		mode: 'albums',
		albums: ["Album1","Album2"],
		labels: {photo:"picture",
		         photos: "pictures"
		        },
		months: ["JANUARY","FEBRUARY","MARCH","APRIL","MAY","JUNE",
		         "JULY","AUGUST","SEPTEMBER","OCTOBER","NOVEMBER","DECEMBER"]
	};

	$("#container").pwi(options);

});
   
}}} 

This example will show the albums page with thumbnails of Album1 and Album2 of Picasa user !YourPicasaUserName. Instead of the label "photo" the label "picture" will be used. All month names will be in capitals.
