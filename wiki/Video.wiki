#summary Showing !YouTube videos

= Introduction =

It is possible to link pictures in Picasa to certain !YouTube videos. When you click on this picture the !YouTube video will be shown instead of the photo.

Note: As !SlimBox does only support pictures this feature is not available when using !SlimBox.

= Showing !YouTube videos =

Showing !YouTube videos is very easy:

  * Select a picture that you want to use to show the video.
  * Start the description of the photo with `"[youtube: <youtube-id>]"`.
  * Add any additional test to the description.

For example, to show the video that is available in the demo (see folder Test) use the
following description:
{{{
[youtube: hgadtxgXZ_k]Show YouTube video
}}}
<br>
= Configuration =

There is one general option for !YouTube videos:

|| *Name* || *Default* || *Description* ||
|| videoBorder || "images/video.jpg" || Image that will be used to overlap the thumbnail of a video ||

= Why not use Picasa video? =

I also looked at Picasa video before I decided to use !YouTube instead. Why did
I choose !YouTube over Picasa? 

  * The Picasa video functionality is basically uploading and viewing, while !YouTube offers many more features
  * To show the Picasa video takes much more effort than showing the !YouTube video
  * Easier to show other video's, next to video's in your own account
